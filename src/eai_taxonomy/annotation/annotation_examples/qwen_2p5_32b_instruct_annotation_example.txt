Classification Logic:

Dewey Decimal Classification: 
- Consider possible FDC classifications: 513.212 (Arithmetic operations on fractions), 510.71 (Mathematics study and teaching)
- Final determination: The document primarily focuses on the arithmetic operation of dividing fractions, which is a specific mathematical concept. Therefore, 513.212 is the most appropriate primary classification. The secondary classification of 510.71 is also relevant as the document serves an educational purpose.

Bloom Taxonomy Classification:
- Consider possible Bloom cognitive process classifications: UNDERSTAND (explaining the steps of dividing fractions), APPLY (applying the steps to solve a specific problem)
- Consider possible Bloom knowledge domain classifications: FACTUAL (specific facts about fraction division), PROCEDURAL (steps and methods for dividing fractions)
- Final determination: The document prominently features the UNDERSTAND cognitive process as it explains the steps involved in dividing fractions. It also includes the APPLY process as it demonstrates the application of these steps to a specific problem. On the knowledge domain, the document primarily deals with PROCEDURAL knowledge, as it outlines the procedure for dividing fractions, with FACTUAL knowledge being secondary as it includes specific facts about the operation.

Document Type Classification: 
- Consider possible Document Type classifications: Reference/Encyclopedic/Educational, Academic/Research
- Final determination: The document is clearly intended as a reference or educational tool, providing a step-by-step guide to solving a fraction division problem. It does not fit the formal structure of an academic paper, so the primary classification is Reference/Encyclopedic/Educational. The secondary classification is -1 - Abstain, as no other category is notably prominent.

Extraction Artifacts Classification: 
- Consider possible Extraction Artifacts classifications: No Artifacts, Irrelevant Content
- Final determination: The text is clean and does not contain any obvious HTML artifacts or extraction errors. However, there is some irrelevant content at the bottom, such as the copyright notice and app download information, which are not core to the mathematical explanation. Therefore, the primary classification is No Artifacts, and the secondary classification is 3 - Irrelevant Content.

Missing Content Classification: 
- Consider possible Missing Content classifications: No missing content, Click Here References
- Final determination: The document appears to be complete and coherent, with no signs of missing passages or incoherent flow. However, there are references to downloading an app, which implies that some content (the app) is referenced but not present. Therefore, the primary classification is No missing content, and the secondary classification is 2 - Click Here References.

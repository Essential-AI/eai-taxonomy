Given the following web document, analyze it and classify it according to following taxonomies. Your response should strictly follow the format below.

For each taxonomy you will be providing a primary and secondary classification. If the secondary classification is not applicable, you may respond with a primary classification and "-1 - Abstain" for the secondary classification.

For context, these are web documents that have been extracted from HTML to plaintext using the resiliparse extraction library. For documents over 30k characters, we chunk them into beginning, middle, and end to limit the context length.


# Taxonomy Definitions


## [Existing Taxonomy] Dewey Decimal System (DDS)


### Taxonomy Definition
Analyze the document and classify it according to the Dewey Decimal System.
Focus on the primary content of the document to determine the most appropriate DDS classification.

### Guidelines
1. Prioritize the most specific applicable DDS classification rather than just broad categories 
2. Consider both the subject matter and the document's intended use/purpose 
3. If the content spans multiple DDS categories, use the most relevant as primary and next most relevant as secondary 
4. Provide clear reasoning for why the chosen classifications are most appropriate


## [Existing Taxonomy] Bloom Taxonomy


### Taxonomy Definition
Classify the document based on both prominent cognitive level of thinking present in the document, as well as the prominent level of knowledge present, using the 2001 update to Bloom's taxonomy as a classification system. 

That is, a document can be labeled on the cognitive process dimension (from lower to higher order thinking) as:

1 REMEMBER

2 UNDERSTAND

3 APPLY

4 ANALYZE

5 EVALUATE

6 CREATE 

The document can also be labeled on the knowledge dimension (from concrete to abstract knowledge) as:

1 FACTUAL

2 CONCEPTUAL

3 PROCEDURAL

4 METACOGNITIVE

### Guidelines
1. When choosing a label, pick the most advanced cognitive processing / knowledge that features prominently in the document. 
2. The knowledge / cognitive processing label doesnt need to represent the most prominent thinking / knowledge in the document; merely notably prominent. Notably prominent means that content is prominent enough that it could serve as a good example of the thinking style / knowledge domain label

## [Custom] Extraction Artifacts Taxonomy


### Taxonomy Definition

0 No Artifacts
  - Text is clean, no obvious leftover HTML or irrelevant elements.
  - If there are no artifacts in the document, select this as the primary and secondary artifact type.

1 Leftover HTML
  - HTML/code artifacts in the document (partial tags, JS server code dumped in the body)

2 Text Extraction Errors
  - Broken math expressions, encoding errors, improperly parsed tables.

3 Irrelevant Content
  - Headers, footers, nav menus, forms at the top or bottom of the page, sidebars, or large non-core sections extracted by mistake (anywhere in text).
  - Look for content that is not core to the purpose of the document and is likely caused by the HTML -> plaintext conversion process.

4 Indeterminate
  - Not enough context to judge artifacts.

  
## [Custom] Missing Content Taxonomy


### Taxonomy Definition

0 No missing content
  - Text seems complete/coherent; no signs of absent passages.

1 Truncated Snippets
  - Obvious "..." or partial paragraphs indicating partial excerpt or cut-off.

2 Click Here References
  - "Click here," "download here," or references to content not present.

3 Incoherent Flow
  - Text is partially unreadable or illogical due to missing key context.

4 Missing Images or Figures
  - Mentions placeholders or references to images/figures not included (e.g., "See Figure 2").

5 Missing Referenced Data
  - Mentions data/tables/datasets not included (e.g., "See Table 3"), but it's absent.

6 Indeterminate
  - Not enough context to judge if anything is missing.
